<p>I really wanted to make something that involved phone spoofing and it worked out pretty well. Most participants eventually figured out that they needed to call back from a different number, as clued by the intro to the possum facts hotline.</p>
<p>Using Twilio was remarkbly easy! One consequence that I hadn&rsquo;t thought about was that the top few search results for phone spoofing services all banned dialing the number I had set up due to the volume of CTF participant calls.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>from flask import Flask, request

facts = [
    &#34;A study conducted by a University of Florida researcher traces the existence of opossums as far back as the extinction of dinosaurs.&#34;,
    &#34;Due to an opossum&#39;s low body temperature and successful immune system, it&#39;s very rare for one to carry rabies.&#34;,
    &#34;In northern regions, opossums often have abnormally short tails - the ends are lost due to frostbite.&#34;,
    &#34;The Virginia opossum has more teeth than any other North American Mammal - 50, to be exact.&#34;,
    &#34;The Virginia opossum is the only marsupial that inhabits the U.S.&#34;,
    &#34;Opossums move around a lot. They typically live in hollow logs, rock crevices, pipes, attics, and beneath buildings.&#34;,
    &#34;Opossums are non-aggressive and non-destructive. They do not dig into the soil or destroy property. They will not harm people or pets.&#34;,
    &#34;Persimmons are one of the opossum&#39;s favorite foods during the long night.&#34;
