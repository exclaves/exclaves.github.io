  <p>What is a loquat? I wondered the same question</p>

<p>This is a loquat:</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Pomological_Watercolor_POM00001040.jpg/1280px-Pomological_Watercolor_POM00001040.jpg" alt="Loquat" /></p>

<p>They taste a bit like a pear, or an apricot, but with less flavor. I guess they’re primarily valued for fruiting about six months offset from most other trees. They also produce <em>a lot</em> of fruit.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="https://www.inkwellhelmets.com" title="Inkwell Helmets">Danielle</a> was kind enough to give me a big bag of loquats, the other day, so I thought I’d try to make jam out of them. I used <a href="http://www.fullandcontent.com/loquat-jam.html" title="loquat jam recipe">this recipe</a>, which worked out to the following ingredients, in my case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 cups seeded loquats</li>
  <li>2.5 cups sugar</li>
  <li>2.5 cups water</li>
  <li>juice of 1/2 of a lemon (added to cut sweetness)</li>
</ul>

<p>The recipe doesn’t use added pectin, as loquats already have plenty. However, this turned out to be way too much sugar! The final jam has an almost candy-like flavor and texture. Oh well, it will be good in yogurt, at least.</p>
