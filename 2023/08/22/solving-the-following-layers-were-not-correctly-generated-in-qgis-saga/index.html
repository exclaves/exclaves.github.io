<p>I found some <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/221924/the-following-layers-were-not-correctly-generated-grid">Stack Overflow</a> posts with the same error but my problem seemed unrelated to the filename/disk space issues mentioned. As I experimented with the data, I discovered two circumstances that produce this rather vague error:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempting to interpolate a field with a space (or possibly other non-alphanumeric characters) in the name</li>
<li>Attempting to interpolate a non-numeric field</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re encountering this, check that you&rsquo;re interpolating a numeric field with a short alphanumeric name.</p>
