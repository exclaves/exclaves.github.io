Most consequences of climate change are felt most severely by the least wealthy and most vulnerable populations in the world. However, this may not be true of every climate change effect.

In 2017, devastating wildfires in Northern and Southern California captured headlines across the US for weeks. Many of these stories accurately described how climate change led to shifting weather patterns that made the frequency and severity of such firestorms more likely.

I was curious about the average wealth of the impacted population in the Southern California wildfires vs. the overall population.

The first thing that I tried to create was a map of wealth, or net worth. This can be very different from income, which is often conflated with wealth! Mapping true wealth is quite hard to do. The American Community Survey does not collect this information, and I was unable to find any other geographically precise data source. However, the ACS does collect information on housing, and since real estate is one of the biggest sources of embodied wealth, I decided to look at that data.

This is a map of median home price multiplied by percent owner occupancy in California. This isn't 100% accurate, because home price and owner occupancy are not uncorrelated variables. However, it was good enough with the data that I had available.

Then, I took a shapefile of the wildland-urban interface -- the vulnerable part of a metro area where development has encroached on the forest and mountains around it. From urban conurbation to urban conflagration.
