title: 'Signal Culture: Realtime tools for 3D video slicing'

At Signal Culture, I'm working on a generalization of the technique I used to make my ["isometric spacelapses."](https://subject.space/projects/isometric-spacelapse/) It's a realtime application for interactively slicing and sliding a video as a 3-dimensional object. A release version and source code will be out by the time I finish my residency.
