I've been remiss about blogging my experiences at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), so I will try to make up for lost time here. Some of my highlights/accomplishments from the first two weeks are:

* Submitting my first real pull request to a large open source project. It's a small one, and it hasn't been approved yet, but it did fix a bug and pass all of the tests!
  * Also kind of helped debug an issue with Zulip development environments on OS X.
* Worked on the first half of MIT's 6.006 with a group of other RCers. It's a lot of fun to have a problem set discussion group again.
  * Paired with another RCer to implement a minheap in Python.
* Learned some [Go](http:/golang.org) and started on the [Cryptopals](http://cryptopals.com/) cryptography challenges using Go.
* Helped debug a weird issue in Docker, and helped another RCer get started with automatic image captioning using neural networks.
* Scanned dozens of documents, pamphlets, and hand-outs from tourist sites across the US, and am exploring spatial organization methods for browsing them.
* Gave a non-technical presentation on the history of New York City's water supply.
  * Dug into some open watershed data, interested in an interactive/browsable version of some of the comparison images I made in this presentation.
  * 
* Learned a bit about shaders, made some [pretty colors](http://player.thebookofshaders.com/?log=180128040341).
* Revived an old project with new input data (aerial photography) to generate "perspectiveless aerial photography."
* Started learning more about relational databases and how to manage them well.
