    </header><p>I&rsquo;ve been remiss about blogging my experiences at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, so I will try to make up for lost time here. Some of my highlights/accomplishments from the first two weeks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submitting my first real pull request to a large open source project. It&rsquo;s a small one, and it hasn&rsquo;t been approved yet, but it did fix a bug and pass all of the tests!
<ul>
<li>Also kind of helped debug an issue with Zulip development environments on OS X.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Worked on the first half of MIT&rsquo;s 6.006 with a group of other RCers. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun to have a problem set discussion group again.
<ul>
<li>Paired with another RCer to implement a minheap in Python.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learned some <a href="http:/golang.org">Go</a> and started on the <a href="http://cryptopals.com/">Cryptopals</a> cryptography challenges using Go.</li>
<li>Helped debug an interesting issue in Docker, involving curious behavior with APFS and sparse files.
<ul>
<li>This was a prerequisite to help another RCer get started with automatic image captioning using neural networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scanned dozens of documents, pamphlets, and hand-outs from tourist sites across the US, and am exploring spatial organization methods for browsing them.</li>
<li>Gave a non-technical presentation on the history of New York City&rsquo;s water supply.
<ul>
<li>Dug into some open watershed data, interested in an interactive/browsable version of some of the comparison images I made in this presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/uploads/2018/01/29/water.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Learned a bit about shaders, made some <a href="http://player.thebookofshaders.com/?log=180128040341">pretty colors</a>.</li>
<li>Started learning more about relational databases and how to manage them well.</li>
<li>Revived an old project with new input data (aerial photography) to generate &ldquo;perspectiveless aerial photography.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<li>Went for a really nice hike in the Hudson Highlands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those were the first three weeks! Hard to believe that it&rsquo;s one quarter over.</p>
