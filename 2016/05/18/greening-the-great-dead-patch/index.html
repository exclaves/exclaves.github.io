<p>Today, I also discovered that the soil we used to start the <a href="/2016/05/16/loquat-jam-and-a-bag-garden/">bag garden</a> was not the right type of soil for planting seeds, and that it needed to be mixed 50-50 with topsoil from a bag or from the ground. Perhaps the fact that the soil was called &ldquo;amend&rdquo; should have been a tip-off.</p>
<p>So, Alison and I replanted the bag garden this morning, which was slightly annoying, but will hopefully result in a better outcome.</p>
<hr>
<p>I also linked the image syntactic fingerprint generator into my directory traversal/metadata extraction script, and figured out the best way to store the sparse vectors in a JSON file.</p>
<p>The best way? For now, as dense vectors.</p>
<p>:/</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see whether I can do something better later. Dictionaries would be pretty easy, but I&rsquo;m not sure about the speed of doing a dot product with a dictionary versus a dense array in JavaScript.</p>
