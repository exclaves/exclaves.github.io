By putting a combination of hardware cloth, chicken wire, and old shelves found in the basement down, I constructed a (so far) effective cat barrier.
In technical updates, I learned how to use a bit of jQuery today, and built a little logarithmic timeline display for some of Bilal&rsquo;s photos, including comparing syntactic image fingerprints in javascript and automatically hiding duplicate images (but allowing them to be revealed with a little animation." />

<p>The result was okay, but a few things are clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It would be great to adjust the clustering of events &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; and be able to see what impact that has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will be important to render multiple events side by side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loading a big JSON file isn&rsquo;t quite practical.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I figured out how to process the images directly into a MongoDB database, and I will experiment further with using Meteor to flexibly render these timelines. However, first I need to determine how best to store a bunch of image assets with Meteor. Perhaps in the Mongo database directly?</p>
