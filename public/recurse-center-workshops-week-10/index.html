    </header><p>I co-hosted two workshops at RC recently, one on Monday, and one on Tuesday. Both went pretty well!</p>
<p>On Monday, Bryan and I ran an &ldquo;interactive art jam.&rdquo; This was something I came up with partially (ok mostly) as an excuse to use <a href="http://www.galaxykate.com/generominos/">Kate Compton&rsquo;s Generominos</a> with a group of people. Last Thursday, I gave a creative brainstorming presentation, and we practiced rapid idea generation using the Generominos as guiding constraints. People seemed to have a lot of fun, and I think that it encouraged participation in the main event on Monday.</p>
<p>![](/uploads/2018/03/15/Screen Shot 2018-03-15 at 10.31.43 AM.png)We received a lot of positive feedback after the Monday event. Participants made beautiful p5.js webcam visualizations, a flower that grows when you yell at it, a sad game about a dance party, a hypnotic Unity world, a thermal printer Zoetrope generator, and Cameron and I made a Kinect/Minim synthesizer in Processing. Some of the feedback reminded me of the reaction to the <a href="https://stupidhackathon.github.io/">Stupid Hackathon</a> â€” the freedom to create something useless or ineffective or just fun also freed people to learn and experiment with technological tools they felt less confident in using.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Conor and I hosted a music live coding night. We created a <a href="https://github.com/connorwalsh/rc-tidalcycles-tutorial">tutorial to some of the essential concepts in TidalCycles</a>, which I think fills a gap in existing reference sources for a sometimes opaque language. We presented the tutorial to a group of about 20 recursers, before splitting off into separate rooms for collaborative jam sessions. This event had two hiccups:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few people had difficulties installing and configuring TidalCycles. It has a lot of dependencies. For future events, maybe something like <a href="http://gallium.live/">Gallium.live</a> (bonus: created by an RCer!) would be easier to configure.</li>
<li>Everyone had difficulty sync-ing their metronomes to other computers. TidalCycles has some issue where it prints a network connection failure message even when it succeeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>But on the whole it went well and people had fun! I also formalized some of my understanding of Tidal in the process of building a tutorial and teaching others.</p>
